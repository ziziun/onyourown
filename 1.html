        <h2>ABOUT TAY</h2>
        <p>I wanna be defined by the things <a href="https://www.taylorswift.com/" target="_blank" title="taylor swift home">that I love</a>. Not the things I hate, Not the things that I'm afraid of. I'm afraid of the things that haunt me in the middle of the night. I just think that <strong>You are what you <u>love.</u></strong></p>

        <p style="margin-top:45px;">My love was as cruel as the cities I lived in
        Everyone looked worse in the light
        There are so many lines that I've crossed unforgiven
        I'll tell you the truth, but never goodbye</p>

        <p>I don't wanna look at anything else now that I saw you
        I don't wanna think of anything else now that I thought of you
        I've been sleeping so long in a 20-year dark night
        And now I see daylight, I only see daylight</p>

        <p>Luck of the draw only draws the unlucky
        And so I became the butt of the joke
        I wounded the good and I trusted the wicked
        Clearing the air, I breathed in the smoke
        Maybe you ran with the wolves and refused to settle down
        Maybe I've stormed out of every single room in this town
        Threw out our cloaks and our daggers because it's morning now
        It's brighter now, now</p>
