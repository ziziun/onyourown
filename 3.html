        <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
        <p>May you write down your feelings and reflect on them years later, only to learn that all the trials and tribulations you thought might kill you… didn’t. I hope that someday you forget that pain ever existed. I hope that if there is a lover in your life, it’s someone how deserves you. If that’s the case, I hope you treat them with care. </p>
